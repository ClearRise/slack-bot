Hello 👋 I hope you’re doing well.

I’m a full-stack developer with a strong focus on Shopify app and theme development, while also working on custom web applications and websites beyond Shopify. I work across the full development lifecycle, including frontend UI/UX, backend logic, integrations, performance optimization, and deployment.

I’ve been involved in production projects ranging from Shopify apps and custom storefronts to broader web applications. In my work, I place a strong emphasis on clean, maintainable code and building solutions that are practical, reliable, and easy to evolve over time.

You can view some of my recent work here:

If you’re looking for support with ongoing development, improvements to an existing product, or building something custom from the ground up, I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can help.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to connecting.
