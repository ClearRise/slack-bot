Hello 👋 Hope you're doing well

I’m a full-stack web developer working as a freelancer from China, focused on building production-ready web applications and custom websites end-to-end. I handle everything from frontend UI/UX to backend logic, APIs, performance optimization, and deployment.

I’ve worked on real-world projects involving modern JavaScript frameworks, custom integrations, and scalable architectures, always aiming for clean code, maintainability, and solid user experience.

You can check out some of my recent work here:

If you’re looking for help with ongoing development, improvements to an existing product, or a specific project from scratch, I’d be happy to chat and see how I can contribute.

Thanks, and looking forward to connecting!
