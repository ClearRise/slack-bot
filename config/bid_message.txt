Hey! 👋

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out because I've been working as a Shopify theme and app engineer for about 5 years now — building custom themes, developing private/public apps, improving store performance, and supporting teams with headless setups.

I'm currently open to new opportunities, whether it's full-time roles, contract work, or one-off projects. If you or your team ever need someone who can handle both frontend and backend on Shopify, I'd be happy to chat and see how I can help.

Thanks, and feel free to reach out anytime! 🚀
